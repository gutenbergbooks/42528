<h2><a name="I" id="I">I</a></h2>

<p>Sometime in the second decade of the
sixteenth century there was born to one
Battista Robusti, cloth-dyer of Venice, a boy
to whom the name Jacopo was given. We
know nothing of the childhood of the lad
who, because his father's business was that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
of a "tintore" or dyer, was known to his
companions as Tintoretto. But one, Carlo
Ridolfi, who was born about the time when
Tintoretto died, towards the close of the
sixteenth century, tells us that the "little
dyer," whose name is written so large in
the history of sixteenth-century art, started
very early to practise drawing, and used his
father's working material in order to give
his productions the colour they seemed to
need. That he must have shown signs of
uncommon talent at an early age is shown
by the fact that he found his way to the
studio or workshop of Titian, the greatest
painter in the Venice of his time; a man
whose position enabled him to require, from
all who sought to become his pupils, a
measure of proficiency that promised to
make their work useful when the demands
of patrons were more than one painter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
could hope to satisfy unaided. Only the lad
who possessed undeniable gifts or powerful
patrons could find a place in the workshop
of the greatest painter of the day,
and Tintoretto was quite without patronage.
The story-tellers of the period assure
us that pupil and master quarrelled, they
even hint that Titian was jealous of the
young student, and this of course is not impossible
because we have plenty of instances
on record in which jealousy has been found
thriving within the studio. Then, again,
clever lads are not always tactful, and an
unbridled tongue may make hosts of enemies,
and destroy the atmosphere of repose in
which alone good work is possible. A
brilliant painter might well have been a
little intolerant of precocious pupils.</p>

<p>Entering into detail, Ridolfi tells us in
his life of the painter that when Tintoretto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
was at work in Titian's studio he copied
some of the master's pictures so cleverly
that Titian told one of his other pupils to
send the boy away, and Robusti was dismissed
from the studio without explanation.
It is a significant fact, at the service of
those who accept the theory of jealousy,
that throughout the years when Tintoretto
was struggling for recognition Titian had
no eyes for his young pupil's work, and
was only led to praise a picture by seeing
it unsigned and exhibited in the open.
There were times when the elder painter
could have placed commissions in the
young man's way, but he seems to have
preferred to help others, of whom Paolo
Cagliari, known as the Veronese, is the
only man whose work retains a large
place in the public eye. But clearly Titian
must have had some other motive as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
as jealousy, for he himself had more work
than he could possibly do, and the help of
a clever pupil like Tintoretto would have
been valuable in times of great stress when
patrons were waxing impatient. Whatever
the other motive may have been it escaped
Ridolfi, and no other record of the early
days is extant.</p>

    <div class="p4 caption">PLATE II.&mdash;THE DOGE ALVISE MOCENIGO<br />

    <p>This portrait, to be seen to-day in the Accademia at Venice, is one
      of the most striking of the long series of the leading citizens of the
      Republic. Tintoretto painted many of these portraits, for he was for
      many years one of the official painters to the Republic. Venice
      holds the best of this work.</p>

<p>Looking at the work of the "little
dyer" it seems reasonable to suggest that
he acted as all great painters before and
after him have done&mdash;that is to say, he
sought what was best in the work around
him, and having collected all the material
he required, evolved his own artistic personality
from a judicious selection. Artists
do not come into this world ready made,
and the period of the making depends upon
the man. For many, life is not long
enough, and it is one of the tragedies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
art work that the mastery over technical
difficulties is sometimes delayed until the
eye is becoming dim and the hand uncertain.
From the very first we find that
Tintoretto was immersed in the affairs of
his art, that he could not hold his hand,
that he laboured with feverish energy, that
no commission was despised, and that
nothing was too large or too small for him
to undertake. Throughout the days of his
youth his industry was devoted entirely to
mastering the difficult technique of his
work, until foreshortening, perspective, correct
anatomy, relative values, light, shadow,
and relief, were his subjects rather than his
masters. Then he was prepared to begin
where so many great Venetian artists had
left off.</p>

<p>It had been a reproach to the Venetians
that for all their colour they were poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
draughtsmen. Needless to add that this
rebuke came from the schools of Florence,
where men were more concerned with correct
drawing than rich colour. But Tintoretto
removed the reproach from Venice,
and, while he learned to draw in fashion
that left the Florentine schools nothing to
teach, he followed Gian Bellini and Titian
into the domain of colour, and his work to-day
reveals many of the best qualities of
the two Italian schools of art in happy
combination. When he was fully equipped
according to his lights, and was prepared
to enter into competition with the men
around him, Tintoretto set out boldly to
achieve the best results&mdash;he knew what he
could do even if he did not know what the
accomplishment was worth. It was not a
part of his mental attitude to rest content
with work done for those who sought the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
service of second-class men. "The form of
Michelangelo, the colour of Titian;" these
were the achievements he sought to realise,
and he wrote these words on the wall of
his workshop in the same spirit as that in
which pious Hebrews still put the declaration
of their faith upon the doorposts of their
houses. He understood that Michelangelo
Buonarotti had said the last word in form,
and that Titian had gone as far in the
direction of colour. Not until he was armed
with patiently acquired skill, extraordinary
natural aptitude, and a temperament that
could not be satisfied with anything less
than complete success, did he feel prepared
to take the world of art by storm, and
then he had put to the credit of his record
a measure of hard work that no other
painter could show.</p>

<p>For the first few years Tintoretto had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
to strive in the ranks of men who, whatever
their gifts, had more chances than he.
Venice was full of artists; commissions did
not always depend upon merit, influence
and favour counted for a great deal, and
the clever son of an obscure dye-worker
could hardly reach the goal of his ambitions
without a long period of waiting. Things
had altered from the days when Titian
came from the mountains of Cadore to the
studio of Gian Bellini, there was now so
much talent in Venice that a man might
have good gifts and yet go hungry. Art had
widened its boundaries, developed the importance
of its expression and the scope of
its appeal, offering wealth and reputation to
those who could succeed in impressing
the statesman, churchman, or conqueror
who held the patronage of the arts to be
one of the special privileges of their state.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
In Florence the tendency was to treat
art as one branch of the many-sided profession
of life. The artist of the day was
sculptor and architect as well; sometimes
he was engineer and statesman, he took
every field of activity for his labours, and
certainly the success of the great men
whose range of endeavour was so wide
was quite remarkable. Happily the Venetians
were less ambitious. Bellini, who is,
in the colour sense, the father of Venetian
art, had a comparatively restricted outlook.
Titian, his pupil, went farther afield and
divorced art from the church, doubtless
Giorgione had he lived would have helped
to make that divorce more effective. Tintoretto,
who was Titian's pupil, just as Titian
had been Bellini's, was content to give all
his energies, his extraordinary industry, and
his great gifts to the service of painting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
He could not enlarge the boundaries because
Titian had carried them already into
the domain of mythology, allegory, and portrait
painting, and the time had not yet
come when landscape could stand by itself.
But Tintoretto, though he could not develop
the theme, managed to develop the treatment,
and became in a sense to be discussed
later on the "father" of impressionism. This
was his special service to art, and must be
regarded as a remarkable discovery when
we see how firmly fixed were the ordinary
painters' conventions in handling subjects.
Titian had broken away from the restrictions
on subject matter, it was left to Tintoretto
to revolt against the conventional handling,
but this revolt was of course the product
of late years. He began where his masters
were leaving off, and he ended by being a
law to himself. It will be seen, judging by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
the statements of his biographers, and particularly
that of Ridolfi to whom we have
referred, that the young painter's gifts and
his habit of thinking for himself and following
his theories into the realm of practice
were in the way of his advancement. He
worked so rapidly that the people to whom
he applied in the first instance for commissions
were a little suspicious. They could
not understand how a man who painted
with lightning rapidity and was prepared to
sell his labour for any price, however small,
could claim to be taken seriously. His
cleverness made them afraid. They do not
seem to have understood the type of artist
that works because work is the very first
law of life, and is content with a small return,
knowing that when once the proper
chance has come it will be possible to
command a better price.</p>

      <p>This extraordinary painting to be seen to-day at the National
      Gallery reveals not only the artist's vivid imagination but the
      wonderful skill with which he can present a flying figure and leave it
      as though supported in mid air. Students of Tintoretto will not fail
      to note the resemblance between the flying figure here and the one in
      "The Miracle of the Slave" in the Venetian Academy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
The general feeling about Jacopo Robusti
is perhaps summed up by Giorgio Vasari in
his "Lives." "He is a great lover of the
arts," says our gossip; "he delights in playing
on various musical instruments; he is a
very agreeable person, but as far as painting
is concerned he has the most capricious
hand, and the boldest, most extravagant, and
most obstinate brain that ever belonged to
painter. Of this the proof lies in his works
and in their fantastic composition so different
from the usage of other painters.
Indeed, Robusti becomes more than ever
extravagant in his recent inventions, and the
strange fancies that he has executed as it
were almost without design, as though he
aimed to show that art is but a jest. He
will sometimes present as finished, sketches
which are just such mere outlines that the
spectator sees before him pencil marks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
made by chance, the result of a bold carelessness
rather than the fruits of design and
judgment."</p>

<p>These are significant words only when
we consider that they were written at a
time when Tintoretto was alive, and Vasari
must have been moved to great excess of
zeal to have gone so far in the painter's
dispraise. Indeed he closes his little sketch
by remarking that Tintoretto after all is
a very clever man and a highly commendable
painter. The special interest of the
criticism lies in its revelation of the attitude
of his contemporaries towards Tintoretto.
For more than a century art had
been moving, pictures had ceased to be
flat, the difficulties of chiaroscuro were
being faced rather than shirked. Atmosphere
was growing, the problems of perspective
were deemed worthy of careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
study. Colour was not only brilliant, but
the secret of mixing colours long since lost
and apparently irrecoverable was known
in the studios of the leading men. But
the very earliest lessons of impressionism
had yet to be taught, and realism had
rendered dull and lifeless pictures that were
hung rather beyond the reach of the spectator's
close scrutiny. Tintoretto saw that
work must be handled in such a fashion
that the spectator who stood some distance
away could get an impression of the whole
of the subject treated. He knew that if
objects were painted with equal values and
the meticulous care of the miniaturist the
canvas would only yield its fruit to those
who could stare right into it. These facts
were a pleasant revelation to him and an
unpleasant one to his contemporaries. His
work was destined to influence Velazquez&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>Velazquez
influenced Goya, the mantle of
Goya fell upon Edouard Manet, and Manet
founded the great impressionist school of
France that has been doing work of extraordinary
merit and enduring interest while
schoolmen of contemporary generations have
been concerned with telling stories in terms
of paint and harking back to the pre-Raphaelities.</p>

<p>The modern work suffers more from
neglect and disregard than that of the great
masters of old time, because nowadays it
is possible to multiply the lowest and most
popular class of picture and scatter it broadcast
among those who have no knowledge
of the aims and objects of art. They think
that a picture is bound to be a good one
if it should chance to appeal to them, forgetful
that their lack of taste may have as
much as anything to do with the appeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
of the work. A picture may please an observer
because the picture is great or
because the observer is small, but the latter
alternative is hardly popular with those
who go conscientiously to galleries.</p>

<p>Vasari tells us many stories of Tintoretto's
inexhaustible activity. Ridolfi does
the same, and it is easy to understand why
a man who could not keep his brush from
his hand for any length of time, and would
accept any price or any commission rather
than remain idle, was rather a terror to his
contemporaries, and earned the title of "Il
Furioso" by which he was widely known.
Few artists in the world's history have
achieved so much, for although we know
of countless frescoes and pictures that have
perished utterly, we still have something
like six hundred works left to stand for
the seventy-five years of the painter's life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
and some of these, such as the works in
the Doges' Palace, are crowded with figures.
Indeed the work in the Doges' Palace might
well stand for the life's monument of any
artist however long-lived and industrious.</p>

<p>It is no fault of Tintoretto that his work
baffles the tired eye. He cannot be studied
in a day, or two days, or even three; you
cannot go to him from other painters. He
demands the closest and most enduring
attention together with some expert guidance
on the occasion of the first visit in
order that the countless points in crowded
canvas may not be overlooked. He was a
man of such breadth of vision, his conceptions
were so magnificent that he must be
approached with something akin to reverence.
We cannot go to him as to Titian
or Bellini and feel that we can bring to the
merit of each canvas the necessary amount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
of appreciation. While the "Paradiso" took
years to complete, some of Tintoretto's
smaller canvases took many months in
the making, although the painter has never
been excelled in the rapidity of execution.
He who hopes to digest in half-an-hour
the work that took Tintoretto half a year
imagines a vain thing. To read some of
the criticism that has been meted out to
Tintoretto is to realise that their own limitations
have given serious trouble to some
of his critics, because he is so vast and so
splendid in his themes, and so extraordinarily
brilliant in his treatment, he has
baffled one generation after another. His
theory of relative values has been misunderstood
and misinterpreted, but to see
him in his true light it is necessary to consider
how many of his successors could
paint a large figured picture on anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
approaching the same scale with an equal
measure of intelligence. Nowadays we
do not look for heroic achievement; and it
is perhaps as well, seeing that there is
none to be had.</p>

<h2><a name="II" id="II">II</a></h2>

<p>Thanks to Carlo Ridolfi we can form a
fairly correct idea of the conditions under
which young Tintoretto lived in the early
days. The expulsion from Titian's studio
must have been a very serious blow to his
hopes and ambitions, but he did not repine
unduly&mdash;he was made of sterner stuff. He
took a small apartment and began those
unremitting labours that were to land him
in the first rank of draughtsmen. Through
Daniele da Volterra, a pupil of Michaelangelo,
he secured the models of the master's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
work that were to teach him so much
about anatomy, and were to be used for experiments
in foreshortening, and the treatment
of light and shade. He had one
friend, an artist known as Schiavone, a
man almost as poor as himself in those
first days of struggle and disappointment&mdash;a
man who had likewise sought instruction
in Titian's studio but had left it without
incurring that great master's ill-will.
One of the earliest commissions that fell
to Schiavone was for the decoration of St.
Mark's Library, but Tintoretto had to wait
longer for work, and some years would
seem to have passed before he realised his
ambition and received a commission to paint
altar-pieces. There are some workers to
whom enforced idleness would be fatal, and
Tintoretto might have been one of them,
but for the fact that he had no capacity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
for indolence, and would work even though
he worked for nothing.</p>

<p>The first church to give him a commission
would seem to be that of Santa Maria
del Carmine, and the impression that he
gave to his masters must have been a
very favourable one, for we find that the
churches of St. Benedetto and Santo Spirito
gave him orders soon after. Then the
Scuola della Trinita recognised his talent,
and gave him an order for certain pictures,
including the famous "Death of Abel"
and the equally famous "Adam and Eve,"
of which John Ruskin said, "this in absolute
power of painting is the supremest
work in all the world." These Scuoli or
confraternities were both wealthy and powerful
bodies, able and eager to give valuable
commissions to artists. They would often
grant permanent pay and regular work to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
the man whose accomplishment satisfied
their requirements, and the work that remains
to us shows that the directors of the
Scuoli were men of taste and discretion.</p>

<p>As soon as Tintoretto felt that he was
within sight of the goal of his ambitions
he married, choosing for his wife one Faustina
of Vescovi, the daughter of a patrician
house, and a woman who seems to have
realised that her husband's devotion to the
ideals of art were likely to make him a
very bad business man. Like many of
the wives of clever men she played the
tyrant in matters that did not concern
the studio, and the painter would seem to
have evaded some of her regulations for his
comfort by saying the thing that was not.
We would not say that he originated the
habit, but it is said to have become popular
and traces of it are still found among husbands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
in the twentieth century. Tintoretto took
a house in the west end of Venice on the
Fondamenta dei Mori overlooking Murano,
and there he worked hard and lived simply.
He must have been a man of engaging
manner and amusing conversation, because
Ridolfi has recorded many amusing little
facts about him in his famous volume of
biographies.</p>

    <div class="caption">PLATE V.&mdash;THE PROCURATOR MOROSINI<br />

      <p class="in0 center padhalf">(From the Venetian Academy)</p>

      <p>This is another of Tintoretto's official pictures. The Procurator,
      a man whose singular dignity is not affected by his rather coarse
      and heavy features, is wearing beautiful robes that are now beginning
      to fade.</p>
    </div>

    <a href="images/i_043l.jpg">
    <img src="images/i_043.jpg" width="339" height="583" alt="" /></a><br />
</div>

<p>Clearly Tintoretto believed that Titian
was his enemy, although we do not find that
the younger man took any steps to demonstrate
his ill-will. It would seem that many
men who came to Tintoretto's studio could
talk of nothing but Titian's virtues, and
that this conversation tired the younger
man, who at last put an end to the gossip
very cleverly. He secured an incomplete
canvas by Titian and painted a figure into
it, then he sent the picture to the house of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
his friend Contarino, where the gossips who
dabbled in literature and art were accustomed
to assemble. All who saw the
picture praised it to the skies, and when
they had finished chattering Tintoretto remarked
that the work they admired so
much was painted partly by himself. Thereafter
the gossips seem to have found some
other topics of conversation, and Tintoretto
was able to pursue his paths in peace without
suffering from comparisons that must
have been odious.</p>

<p>The painter's union was blessed with
children, of whom his daughter Marietta
was perhaps his favourite. Until she was
fifteen years of age she used to accompany
her father through Venice dressed as a
boy. She learned a great deal from him,
and became a portrait painter, dying some
little time before her father, to his great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
grief. Some few of Tintoretto's remarks
have come down to us. He is said to have
held that black and white are the most
beautiful colours, and with the record of
this opinion it becomes curious to see
in Tintoretto's pictures how the splendid
colouring that was needed to express his
work in the days when he was young
grew more and more sombre as time passed
on, until the dominant tone became the
golden brown that is familiar to students
of his pictures. As a young man he revelled
in bright colours, but in middle and old age
their charm passed. There is something
very human about this attitude towards externals.
Tintoretto placed a very great
importance upon drawing, more importance
indeed than any of the Venetians had
placed upon it before his time. He thought
very little of copies from the nude, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
no believer in the beauty of the average
nude form, and holding that the hand of
the artist is necessary in order to express
to the full the beauty that the lines of
the body suggest. One pauses to wonder
how he would have regarded Schopenhauer's
criticism of the female form.</p>

<p>Tintoretto had two sons, who became
his pupils when they were old enough; he
was more fortunate in his family than was
his great master and rival, and his home
life would seem to have been a tranquil
one, because we have learned from Vasari
that he was a good musician, and played
well on several instruments. Music does
not flourish in unhappy homes. He could
not have entertained as Titian did, because
throughout his life he was a comparatively
poor man, but he gathered round him some
of the most interesting people in his native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
city and, with the exception of Titian
and Aretino, all seemed to have been well
pleased with him. Aretino, of course, being
the greatest gossip of his century, could
not keep his tongue quiet under any circumstances,
and never hesitated to say an
unpleasant thing as long as it had wit
or humour. Tintoretto bore with his old
master's factotum as long as he could, and
then his patience giving out, invited him
to the studio and proceeded to take his
measure with a naked dagger, recording it
as though he was going to paint a portrait.
Aretino, who seems to have been an arrant
coward, took the hint and controlled his
unruly tongue. Perhaps he realised that it
was unnecessary as well as unwise to provoke
a man who asked for nothing better
than to be allowed to spend his life in hard
work free from interruption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
It is quite likely that Tintoretto's amazing
gifts, together with his capacity for hard
work, would have brought him very rapidly
to the front, had not Titian been the pride
of the Venetians, but while the great painter
from Cadore dominated the City of the
Lagoons no other man could hope to stand
beside him, and certainly Tintoretto did not
improve his own chances by his violent early
search for work, and his startling offers to
paint pictures of any size for any price. Inasmuch
as he did not place a high value
upon his own work, it was unreasonable to
expect that his patrons would fall into the
error of over-praising it. In setting a value
upon their own work most men remember
that they are sellers, nor is it the business
of buyers to raise the price.</p>

<p>It is no easy task to hunt out Tintoretto's
countless pictures in Venice. Including<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
panels, altar-pieces, and portraits, the work
in the Doges' Palace, in the Accademia, and
the collections of private owners, there must
be of this painter's work well-nigh three
hundred examples whose authenticity is beyond
dispute, while, needless to say, there are
plenty of pictures to be found in the collections
of dealers and amateurs that have
rather more than a suspicion of Robusti's
hand, though they can hardly claim to be
painted by him alone. Like all other
masters Tintoretto had his pupils, and his
children and pupils between them would
appear to be very largely responsible for
some of the pictures that bear his name.
To add to the difficulties of the visitor,
Tintoretto has suffered more than most
men from exposure, neglect, and repainting.
The salt-savoured air of Venice is by no
means the best in the world for pictures;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
and candles, though they may save their
pious purchasers from many years' suffering
in Purgatory, have an awkward habit of
smoking and spoiling the altar pictures
that stand before them. Candle smoke
respects neither madonna nor saint, and
though raised with the best intentions, will
destroy masterpiece or daub with equal
certainty and indifference. In Tintoretto's
time piety was more fashionable than art
criticism, and his pictures have suffered very
much from the devotion they have inspired
in the breasts of those to whom candles were
a short-cut to salvation. Happily the Scuola
of St. Roque, with its countless beautiful
works of the master on panel and ceiling
and staircase, still preserves a great deal of
its original beauty. The Doges' Palace has
a splendid collection, including the famous
"Paradise" in the Hall of Council, while other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
apartments in the palace boast specimens
of the master's most inspired work. The
Royal Palace, and that of Prince Giovanelli,
are very rich in the fruit of Tintoretto's
labours, while the Academy of Fine Arts
from which a part of the pictures given
here were taken, holds some of the
painter's masterpieces in really favourable
positions.</p>

<p>In the Doges' Palace the neck and back
of the man who wishes to study Tintoretto
must endure constant strain, and the great
compositions are so hard to understand that
headache often anticipates comprehension,
and appreciation gets no chance. The
Academy is not too crowded, save at the
season of the great American invasion, and
there it is possible to enjoy Tintoretto
quietly.</p>

<div id="PLATE_VI" class="figcenter" style="width: 578px;">
    <div class="p4 caption">PLATE VI.&mdash;QUEEN ESTHER FAINTING BEFORE AHASUERUS<br />

      <p class="in0 center padhalf">(Hampton Court Palace)</p>

      <p>Here we have one of Tintoretto's spirited compositions in which
      he makes no attempt to adapt his costumes to the period of the
      Bible story. One and all the figures are sixteenth-century Venetians.</p>
    </div>

    <a href="images/i_054l.jpg">
    <img src="images/i_054.jpg" width="578" height="421" alt="" /></a><br />
</div>

<p>The more we study Tintoretto the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
more his mastery for every branch of his
art becomes apparent. His composition
is the more marvellous because he had
not had the advantage of receiving inspiration
from other masters. He carried composition
farther than it had gone before,
bringing to his aid in that work a certain
dramatic instinct that does not seem to
have been associated with the painter's
workshop before his time. He redeemed
Venetian painting from the charge of bad
drawing that had been levied against it
by the Florentines, and when we come
to colour we find that Tintoretto has
little or nothing to yield in this department
even to Titian himself, and that he gets
many of his finest effects from lower tones
than those that appealed to his master.
Some of his colour effects are less daring,
less theatrical, less immediate in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
appeal than those of Titian, but when
they are understood they are hardly to
be less admired, although we have to
admit that in many cases they have been
restored, and retouched by many well-meaning
fools who did not understand
the extraordinary delicacy of treatment
that gave the canvas its pristine quality.
A picture by Tintoretto in which the rich
golden brown tints have survived the
passages of the years and the hand of
the restorer, is at once a thing to wonder
at and be grateful for.</p>

<p>Like all great painters Tintoretto had
little use for drawings. He did not believe
in making elaborate studies; we can learn
this from his first work for the Scuola
of St. Roque, when he entered into competition
with several big painters, and
managed to present a finished picture to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
his startled patrons and competitors in
the shortest possible time. Vasari tells
the story, how the brotherhood decided to
have some "magnificent and honourable
work" on the ceiling of the Scuola, and
asked Salviati, Zucchero, Paolo Cagliari
(Veronese), and Tintoretto to prepare a
design. "While the artists were giving
themselves with all diligence to the preparations
of their designs," writes Vasari,
"Tintoretto made an exact measurement
of the space for which the picture was
required, and taking a large canvas he
painted it at his usual speed, without
taking any one into his confidence, and
fixed it in the place destined to receive
it. On the morning when the brotherhood
assembled to see the designs and determine
the matter, they found that Tintoretto had
completed his work, that he had even fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
it in its place. At this they were very
angry, saying that they desired designs,
and had not commissioned him to do more
than prepare one. Robusti replied that this
was his method of preparing designs, and
that he knew no other, that all designs
and models for a work should be executed
in this fashion to the end that persons
interested might see what would be offered
to them, and might not be deceived. Finding
the brethren were still displeased, Tintoretto
added that if they did not think fit
to pay for the work, he would make a
present of it to them for the sake of the
saint from whom he had received much
kindness. The brotherhood could say
no more, for they dare not refuse a
gift offered to their patron, and so the
picture was accepted, and the brethren
had to make their peace as best they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
could with the angry and disappointed
competitors."</p>

<p>It would be pleasing to write at length
about the work that Tintoretto contributed
to the buildings of the brotherhood,
but in the appendix to his third volume
of the "Stones of Venice," John Ruskin
has dealt so completely and so admirably
with the master that those who are interested
will find all they seek in his pages.
In the lower hall are an "Annunciation,"
an "Adoration of the Magi," an "Assumption
of the Virgin," a "Presentation of
Jesus," and several others. In the upper
hall there is the wonderful masterpiece of
"St. Roque in Heaven," together with
many pictures of the great heroes of
Bible History, and the "Last Supper"
that Velazquez copied. The refectory
holds the great "Crucifixion," and eleven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
panels devoted almost entirely to single
figures.</p>

<p>Tintoretto had a hard struggle to become
the painter for the wealthy brotherhood,
which had already commissioned work
from Titian, Giorgione, Schiavone, and other
men of light and leading, but when he had
once secured a footing he did not lose the
confidence of the brethren. They realised
that the master was second to none in the
honourable ranks of their painters, and
indeed the brotherhood is best remembered
to-day because it chose Tintoretto to paint
so many of its masterpieces. It would have
been a pleasant task to reproduce some
of these works here, but it would have
been impossible to put on a small page,
with any hope of conveying a fair idea of
their extraordinary fascination, the "Massacre
of the Innocents," "Christ before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Pilate," the "Crucifixion," or other pictures
of that size. It has seemed better on this
account to rest content for the most part
with single figures, and to emphasise the
one aspect of the painter's many merits.
His mastery of composition must be left
for those who go to Venice or to some
other of the cities wherein the work is
seen in all its glory.</p>

      their portraits that they do not interest us.</p>

<p>Some five years would seem to have
elapsed between the time when Tintoretto
forced his picture of St. Roque upon the
astonished brotherhood, and the time when
he painted the "Crucifixion" for the Scuola
in return for a fee of 250 ducats, becoming
thereafter a member of the brotherhood.
He worked for them for ten years or more,
leaving the question of terms to their judgment,
but receiving a very fair price. By the
middle of the 'sixties his position in Venice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
was assured. He was accepted on every
hand as a man who honoured the churches
and brotherhoods, civil or religious, that
employed him. Unlike Titian he was very
reliable, and does not seem to have accepted
commissions and then to have
ignored them because better work came
along unexpectedly. His work in the
churches is very varied and is scattered
throughout Venice. Ridolfi refers to his
early pictures in the Church of St. Benedict,
but they are not to be found there now.
Santa Maria dell 'Orto, which was one of
the first to employ his brush, holds his
famous "Last Judgment," a composition of
singular nobility, painted with great technical
skill, and the wonderful imagination
that inspired all the painter's efforts. Unfortunately
the details on the canvas are
not easily seen, and the whole work would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
appear to have been handed over more
than once to the renovator whose tender
mercies, like those of the wicked, are cruel.
In the same church there are two "Martyrdoms,"
one of St. Paul or St. Christopher,
and another of St. Agnes, and there is the
fascinating "Presentation of the Virgin,"
which ranks side by side with Titian's
masterpiece in the Venetian Academy.
Tintoretto's colour scheme is more subdued,
but the composition is singularly
attractive, and the painter's knowledge of
perspective, his gift of conveying atmosphere,
his skill in handling the human
figure in any position have hardly been
seen to greater advantage than in this
master work. Perhaps because the church
Santa Maria dell 'Orto received the artist's
earliest work he loved it above all other
churches, for it held the vault of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
Vescovis and he chose to be buried there.
Clearly he was one for whom his wife's
family held no terrors. Many other painters
figure in this church, which lies well away
from the city's main thoroughfares, by the
canal Rio della Madonna dell 'Orto. Palma
Vecchio is to be seen there and that Girolamo
who is said to have acted for Titian
when he wished to expel Tintoretto from
his workshop. The church also has a
"Pieta" by Lorenzo Lotto, and a "Madonna"
by Gian Bellini. Tintoretto's burial
in the church is recorded on a tablet.</p>

<p>The church of San Cassiano has two
or three pictures by Tintoretto, and that of
San Francisco della Vigna is said to have
another, but it is not to be seen, and the
brethren of St. Francis who pace to and
fro along the broken-down cloisters can
give no information to intruders armed with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
red guide-books. San Giorgio Maggiore is
rich in Tintorettos, and has one or two attractive
works by Bassano. A very famous
"Last Supper" was painted for this church,
but the work will not vie with much that
Tintoretto did elsewhere. Santa Maria dei
Frari has a beautiful "Massacre of the
Innocents." San Marziale has an "Ascension,"
and two "Annunciations," together
with a work that the painter did not live
to finish. On the Giudecca in the old
Franciscan Church of the Redentore, where
a famous water festival is held throughout
one night in the summer, there are two
splendid examples of the painter's work,
and in the church of the Madonna della
Salute there is a "Marriage of Cana."
This church holds several pictures by Titian
and other masters of renown. Santo Stefano
is said to have some famous pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
by Tintoretto in the sacristy, but the writer
has not seen them.</p>

<p>The list of church pictures is by no
means exhausted. It would not be easy
to deal with them without giving these
pages a suspicious resemblance to a catalogue.
The visitor to Venice may be well
advised to visit as many churches as he
can, and to remember that many a building
of little latter-day significance holds priceless
work belonging to the sixteenth century.
In Florence there are a score or
more of Tintoretto's pictures in the galleries
of the Uffizi and the Pitti Palace; in the
former there is a striking replica of the
"Wedding at Cana" in the Venetian church
of the Madonna della Salute, but all these
have their crowd of admirers; they are
catalogued and clearly seen. In Venice, on
the other hand, many a church from which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
the hurried tourist turns aside holds one or
more of Tintoretto's masterpieces, and if it is
well hung and has escaped the troublesome
attentions of restorer and candle-burner, it
will well repay quiet study.</p>

<p>The story that a great picture has to tell
travels far beyond its own subject-matter,
and the quality of that imagination which is
associated with all great work is seen in a
very high degree in many a church picture
by the great Venetian master. Perhaps he
owes his heroic achievements to Michelangelo.
The full story of his indebtedness
has been treated at length by John Ruskin,
for whom the painter's work held great attractions;
but it may be said, without fear
of contradiction, that where a picture has
survived its surroundings, the vigour of
mind, the breadth of view, the dramatic
sense of the painter, his splendid power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
seeing the great stories of Old or New
Testament in their most dramatic aspect,
will satisfy the most critical sense of the
onlooker almost as much as the conquest
of difficulties in light, shade, foreshortening,
composition, and graded tones please the
man who has mastered the technicalities
of the painter's art.</p>

<p>Looking at Tintoretto's work and remembering
that he hardly stirred beyond
the limits of the Republic, it is impossible
not to reflect upon the chance and luck that
beset the lives of men. Tintoretto, with his
splendid gifts, his rapid accomplishment, his
courteous manner, remains in Venice; his
fame suffering because he could see far beyond
the limits that beset the view of his
great and popular master. Had Tintoretto
not been able to see quite so clearly, had
he not alarmed contemporary criticism by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
groping successfully after the first truths of
impressionism, he might have been in the
fulness of time the court painter of popes
and emperors. His splendour might have
been diffused throughout Italy; it might have
travelled to Spain, then the greatest of all
world powers. Titian, for all his extraordinary
gifts, had certain conventional limitations.
Tintoretto, equally gifted, could see
more deeply into the truths that underlie
painting, so he did not prosper in like degree.
Happily for him he was a man who worked
for work's sake, as long as his hands were
full and he could labour from morning until
night, the pecuniary and social results hardly
seemed worth bothering about. We know
that Titian, whose income was much larger
than Tintoretto's, was loud in his complaints
of bad times and inadequate payments, but
if Tintoretto complained, Ridolfi has forgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
to record the fact. There is no attempt
here to belittle Titian or to praise
Tintoretto; each was a man for whom the
sixteenth century and its successors must
need be grateful. The difference between
them was temperamental, and is worth recording,
though it is not set down in any
spirit of unfriendly criticism.</p>

<p>It would seem that the pictures for the
brotherhood of St. Roque secured for Tintoretto
the crowning honour of his life, the
commission to bring his brush to the service
of the Doges' Palace. It is hardly too much
to say that just as the Doges' Palace is the
most remarkable monument of the Venetian
Republic left in Venice to-day, so Tintoretto's
pictures are the most remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
decorations in the palace itself. There must
be fifty or more of them, if we include the
Hall of Grand Council, the Hall of Scrutiny,
the College, the Entrance and the Passage
to the Council of Ten, the Ante-room to the
Chapel, the Senate and the Salon of the
Four Doors; but the task of painting fifty
pictures, stupendous though it may seem,
is not realised until we remember the size
and quality of some of these works. The
"Paradise," for example, in the Council Hall,
is more than twenty-five yards long, and is
such a work as many a painter would have
given the greater part of his life to; but
Tintoretto had little more than six years to
live when he undertook the work, and there
is no doubt that while the brain behind the
picture was always his, the hand was sometimes
that of his son or one of his pupils.</p>

<p>It may be supposed that most painters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
who have reached Tintoretto's age when
they received their commission for the Ducal
Palace, would have hesitated to begin work
on such a colossal scale. They would have
felt that the span of their life could hardly
stretch much farther, and knowing that
much was to be done in the way of portraits
and small pictures, would have been
content with these. It was characteristic of
Tintoretto that he should at once undertake
pictures on the largest scale known
to painters. Not only did he undertake
the work, but he accomplished it.</p>

<p>The student of Tintoretto who finds
himself in Venice should, we think, endeavour
to leave the Doges' Palace alone
until he has watched the painter's development
in the various Venetian churches.
Then he should study the work done for
the brotherhood of St. Roque, and finally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
should go to St. Mark's to see the crowning
achievement of one of the greatest
men who ever took a paint-brush in hand.
Students of opera will have noticed how a
great singer will sometimes keep his voice
back until the work is nearly over, in order
to put all his energy into the last act, and
so leave an impression that will not be
forgotten easily. So it was with Tintoretto.
He did splendid work in many
directions, but saved himself for the last
act, and the crowning achievement of his
life was reserved for the Doges' Palace.
There all the inspiration that had blossomed
in the Venetian churches, and budded in
the Scuola of St. Roque, came suddenly
into flower, and the visitor to the palace
will look in vain throughout the civilised
world for an equally enduring monument
to any one man. Other great artists have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
left their traces in many cities, but it may
be doubted whether Michelangelo and
Raphael in the Vatican have left a more
enduring record than Tintoretto gave to
the Palace of the Doges. So vast was his
achievement, so brilliant was his imagination,
that our eyes, trained down to see
small things, and unaccustomed to realise
the full idea underlying great pictures,
tremble before the "Paradise" and "Venice
with the Gods and the Doge Nicolo da
Ponte," or the "Capture of Zara," or "St.
Mark Introducing the Doge Mocenigo to
Christ," or the splendid "Descent from the
Cross," in the Senate, or the Pagan picture
in the Salon of the Four Doors, in
which Jupiter gives Venice the Empire of
the Sea. Any one of these pictures might
have been regarded as the crowning achievement
in the life of a very considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
painter. Before them all imagination stops.
Certainly Tintoretto was a long time coming
into his kingdom, but there could have
been few to dispute his supremacy when
he arrived.</p>

<p>In 1574 Tintoretto applied to the Fondaco
de Tedeschi for a broker's patent, and
thus history repeated itself, for it will be
remembered that Titian had endeavoured
to secure Bellini's place in the great house
of the German merchants, and now Tintoretto
was supplanting Titian. The application
seems to have been quite successful.
The house to-day serves as a general post-office,
and still shows some slight trace of
the frescoes of Giorgione and Titian. There
does not seem to be any record of work
that Tintoretto did for the German merchants,
but the appointment was largely
an honorary one as far as the work went,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
although it brought a certain income to
the fortunate owner of the office. Tintoretto
had now reached the time when his
work could no longer be ignored, and even
Florence which looked askance at art in
Venice elected the painter a member of
its Academy, an honour that was conferred
also upon Titian, Paul Veronese, and a
few smaller men.</p>

<p>Throughout all the years in which the
painter's art was maturing, and the circle of
his patrons was widening, he seems to have
lived a quiet and uneventful life in Venice,
seeking friends in his own circle, labouring
diligently in his studio, and never permitting
the claims of affairs lying outside his work
to tempt him to be idle. A man of happy
disposition, with no vices, and no extravagant
tastes, he would seem to have found his
earning sufficient for his need, and to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
been happy in his home life, although we
have already recorded the fact upon Ridolfi's
authority that like so many other good men
Tintoretto was in the habit of telling lies to
his wife. Signora Robusti must have been
a little trying when she sought to regulate
her husband's expenditure, the times of his
going out and coming in, and other trifles
of the sort that good women delight to take
an interest in.</p>

<p>The great grief of Tintoretto's life was
happily delayed until 1590, when the well-beloved
Marietta, who had been her father's
friend and companion for so long, died. The
shock must have been a very serious one,
for Tintoretto himself was well over seventy,
but it does not seem to have diminished his
activity. He would appear to have given
all his days to his own labour, or the superintendence
of the labours of others, and so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
the years crept on uneventfully for him, until
the last day of May 1594 when his strenuous,
vigorous, and brilliant career found its closing
hour, and those whom he left behind, together
with a great concourse of admiring
citizens, took him to the tomb of his wife's
house in the Church of the Madonna dell
'Orto, which he had enriched with so much
fine painting. His daughter, having predeceased
him&mdash;as we have seen, she was a
portrait painter, and her father's dearest
friend&mdash;his son Domenico carried on the
family work, and completed his father's commissions,
but neither brain, nor hand, nor
eye could compare with those that were
now at rest, and the younger Tintoretto
makes small claim upon the attention of
artist or historian.</p>

<p>So a very great man passed out of the
life of Venice, and for a brief while his fame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
slumbered, but in years to come great artists,
Velazquez foremost among them, made the
great city of the Adriatic a place of pilgrimage
for his sake. His influence, travelling
on another road, extended as far as Van Dyck.
We have already traced the descent to the
modern school of impressionism, but he
would be a bold man who would say that
the influence of Tintoretto is exhausted, or
holds that he has nothing to teach the
twentieth century. His light will hardly
grow dim as long as his painting has a
claim upon the attention of civilised men.</p>
